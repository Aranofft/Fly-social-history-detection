# Fly-social-history-detection
A data analysis algorithm for detecting the way a fly was socially raised, in a group or isolated, by the way he behaves in a group as a grownup. The algorithm is based on real data recorded in a biologic lab, and advanced machine learning tools.
- The project was written in the jupyter notebook named 'Project_Fly detection - version 2'
- The pdf version is under the name 'Project_Fly detection - Final PDF'
- The detected features of the flies behavior and their description are listed in the file 'Param_init'
- You can find additional background on the pervious fly research at the attached article named: 'Bentzur et al'
